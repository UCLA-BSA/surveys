\title{Faculty Search: Student Feedback}
\author{Prepared by: Emilie Campos}
\date{2020-02-05}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

We appreciate the committee's interest in gauging students' opinions
regarding the faculty search. The survey distributed to the students is
an imperfect measure of a candidate's ability to perform as an educator
and researcher but we hope that this supplementary feedback will aid in
your decision. We want to warn you that the sample sizes for each
survery were small as a whole and wildy different for each candidate so
the rankings are almost arbitrary. However, we feel that the comments
section reflects student interest more appropriately.

The survey distributed to the students asked the questions, with fields
for additional comments:\\
1. Do you believe this person would be a good instructor?\\
2. Do their research interests align with yours?\\
3. Would you like to see them join the department?

Notable comments:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Andrew Holbrook

  \begin{quote}
  ``I think the candidate had a clear presentation, but I was a little
  put off by the way he answered some of the questions from the
  audience. I think he would have clear lectures, but I'm unsure if I
  would feel comfortable coming to him if I was confused about lecture
  material because he didn't give me the impression that he could or
  would be willing to explain concepts in simpler terms to help students
  "get it".''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``His research is an area in which our department is somewhat weak,
  but a lot of students are interested in.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``Andrew is very knowledgeable, very friendly, and has a really strong
  background both in theory and computation. He's great both as a
  researcher and mentor, and his passion for stats is infectious.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``I've discussed statistics with Andrew several times and his
  explanations of difficult ideas are always very clear. He's also very
  patient.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``From his job talk Andrew is good at teaching and his research is
  quite modern as well as with exciting applications.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``He seemed a bit abrasive and impatient.''
  \end{quote}
\item
  Wesley Tansey

  \begin{quote}
  ``He is a good researcher himself, and he can bring connections with
  high-profile labs (such as the NIH automatic cell line testing lab he
  mentioned during the talk).''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``I thought his research was fascinating and his presentation of the
  information was good. I appreciated his emphasis on collaboration with
  scientific experts and the data-driven approach. As a person, he was
  very approachable and great to talk to! I think he can help fill the
  department's gap in computation and data-science methods.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``He explains things in simple and easy to understand terms, and he
  addressed questions from the audience really well.''
  \end{quote}
\item
  Jessica Gronsbell

  \begin{quote}
  ``Her industry experience will be helpful in mentoring students who
  plan to go into industry.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``EHR Data is very important, and it would be great to have someone in
  our department working with it.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  Her talk is clear and informative with details and visualization. The
  result section is a bit weak. The theoretical part and assumption need
  more explanations. Some simulations with noise need to be considered
  for the EHR data as well."
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``I had the opportunity to have lunch with Dr.~Gronsbell, and it was
  apparent to me that she's an educator at heart. She's clearly talented
  in research, given her training (PhD and postdoc) and current
  position, but she's also committed to being an educator and is
  returning to academia to fulfill this desire. The department would
  benefit from having a faculty member who has recent industry
  experience but has a passion for mentorship. I thought her talk was
  clear, and I liked the way she handled questions from the audience
  first by repeating the question to make sure she understood it, then
  by providing a clear answer.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``She answers questions thoughtfully and thoroughly and makes sure she
  understands the question being asked first before rushing into an
  answer. Seems very meticulous.''
  \end{quote}
\item
  Allison Meisner

  \begin{quote}
  ``She wasn't able to simplify when asked to re-explain and idea. This
  is an important quality for teachers when teaching confused
  students.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``Her presentation was clear even though I wasn't originally familiar
  with the research area. She seemed happy to answer questions from the
  audience and was clear with her answers. She just seems like a really
  approachable person and someone students can feel comfortable going to
  with questions if they are lost in a class.''
  \end{quote}
\item
  Zhengwu Zhang

  \begin{quote}
  ``There were times in the presentation and while he was answering
  questions that I felt like the speaker's explanations were quite
  vague. This could've been due to the complicated nature of the
  material and his desire not lose his audience among the weeds, but I'm
  not sure.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``He failed to give a clear explanation of the basic problem setting,
  even after prompting from the audience.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``I liked his answer the question about his big picture goal. His
  philosophy about research and finding what excites him and doing that
  daily resonates with me. Students would benefit from an advisor with
  that mentality.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``His talk was hard to follow. He took very little time to explain
  diffusion MRI. I feel like this talk was aimed at statisticians
  already very familiar with the scientific application and methods.
  Even then I would have a hard time following. I thought his research
  was interesting since I'm generally interested in the brain. But who
  knows, maybe in one on one research meetings he would clarify
  things.''
  \end{quote}
\item
  Sean Jewell
\item
  Lan Luo

  \begin{quote}
  ``I think her presentation was clear and she answered audience
  questions clearly, even though it was apparent that some didn't agree
  with her approach to the problem. She seems approachable and like
  someone students could come to with questions if they were lost in a
  class.''
  \end{quote}

  \begin{quote}
  ``This talk was the most accessible for me, despite some substantial
  math.''
  \end{quote}
